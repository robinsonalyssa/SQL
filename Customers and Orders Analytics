#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT (*)
FROM BIT_DB.jansales; 

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT (*)
FROM BIT_DB.jansales
WHERE product='iPhone'; 

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT cust.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.febsales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON cust.order_id=feb.orderID;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT DISTINCT product, MIN (price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP by product
ORDER by price ASC
LIMIT 1; 

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity), SUM(quantity)*price as revenue, location
FROM FebSales
WHERE location LIKE "548 Lin%";

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT (cust.acctnum), AVG (quantity)*feb.price
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE feb.quantity>2;
